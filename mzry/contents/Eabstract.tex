ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (abbreviated as ACM-ICPC or just ICPC) is an annual multi-tiered competitive programming competition among the universities of the world. This contest is designed to show students' ability of innovation, teamwork, analysis problem, solve problem and coding under pressure. After 30 years of development, ACM-ICPC has become the most influential collegiate programming contest. 

The programming contest use Black-box testing method to judge contestants' program. In Black-box testing, tester only know the functionality of an application (e.g. what the software does and the input/output format), tester design multiply testcases fit in the corresponding format to test. Based on this method, Online Judge System (OJ) can compile, test, analysis and judge multiply kinds of language. Not only in programming contest, many teachers introduce this system into computer language course and achieve significant results.

In this thesis, the writer first introduces the developing trend of Online Judge System through several popular Online Judge Systems, and take a tourial of MVC architecture and how to use MVC in the web application. Then he devises a simple Distributed Online Judge System with Java Spring MVC framework and angularJS, and describes it.
